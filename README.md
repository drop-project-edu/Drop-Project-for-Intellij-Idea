* IntelliJ IDEA installed
* Access to Drop Project Website

## How to get it

* Access the IDE settings in File > Settings, or access directly through the settings icon in the upper right corner
* Go to the Plugins section
* Go to the Marketplace section in plugins and search for Drop Project
* Select Install

## How to use

* This plugin is mainly concentrated in a toolwindow, which is probably in the right panel of your IDE
* Login with your credentials (Your name; Your Drop Project Token)
* First icon in the toolbar is to add an assignment
* Second icon is to submit your code

## How to create a new version

* Make sure CHANGELOG.md includes all the changes of the version to be created, under the unreleased. Don't create the version itself, it will be created automatically
* Change the `pluginVersion` property on `gradle.properties`
* Update, if necessary, the `pluginUntilBuild` property
    * In this case, make sure to test the plugin in that Intellij version. Change the platformVersion property and execute `Run Plugin`.
* Execute `Run Verifications`
* Push to github. This will create a draft release.
* Publish that release - this will trigger a github action that will publish the plugin to the marketplace.

It may be wise to first publish the plugin in the beta channel. To do that, just append "-beta" to the version number (e.g. 0.9.7-beta)
Notice that beta plugins don't show up in the marketplace by default. You have to add this custom plugin repository: 
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/beta/list. To do this, go to settings > plugins > click the gear icon > Manage plugin repositories
